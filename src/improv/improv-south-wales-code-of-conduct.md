# Improv Code of Conduct

Improv is a fun activity, but there are a few rules we need to follow to keep the class safe and happy. 

This is a guide that informs you how you are expected to behave, and how you should expect your classmates to behave, before, during, and after classes or events. 

Issues that occur outside of rehearsals or class, but affect the class itself are also considered. 

## Physical Safety
Unless specifically stated before an exercise or class, there is a complete ban on the following:

* Picking up team-mates
* Jumping on team-mates backs
* play fighting
* physical striking or pushing
* Pinning down or restricting the movement of someone
* Actual kissing
* Placing any body part in another performers mouth, ears, or any other orifice ü§¶üèª

These still count even if you happen to be improvising with someone you do these things with outside of the class or workshop.

Touching rules will be by individual consent and will be respected. There is a complete ban on touching ‚Äúswim-suit‚Äù areas, even if someone says they consent to it.

## Consent
Any touching is by individual consent. There will be regular check-ins before class to establish what physical interaction you are happy with when performing. Please respect others' requests. 

## Subject Matter and Triggers
Some subject matters can trigger deep upset in performers and audience members. Some of these subjects are often part of comedy as shock comedy or "gallows" humour, for example, suicide, animal cruelty etc. 

The truth is, we never know what life event a teammate or audience member may have experienced from week to week, from relationship break ups to family deaths. Please take great care when approaching such subjects. 

There will be regular check-ins for you to establish which subject matters you don't want to come up. Please do your best to respect others' requests. 

I will always do my best to catch any moments where a trigger accidentally comes up. If you accidentally bring up a trigger, do not worry, we will simply rewind any scenes and re-try.

If you do not feel comfortable talking about a trigger in front of the group, you can message me in confidence and I will ensure it is identified. 

There will always be a request to avoid pet cruelty or pet deaths, and suicide. 

## Discrimination
Deliberate or habitual discrimination on the grounds of Gender, Race, Religion, Identity, Age, Neuro-diversity, and/or other protected characteristics will not be tolerated. Accidental occurrences of discriminatory behaviour will always be reviewed and resolved.

## Harassment
Classes are for learning improv and building a team. They are not the place to make moves on fellow class members, and are not necessarily where members want to experience such activity. Respect this.

Bullying of any form will not be tolerated. Be careful if your sense of humour involves teasing.

## Alcohol, and other substances
I understand that improv can be nerve-wracking and you may feel you need a drink before participating and this is fine. However, it is preferred that performers do not come to events inebriated, and save drinking or other substance use for after class or events.

If I deem that someone is too inebriated to take part safely, I reserve the right to remove them. This is for the safety of you and the whole team, and the quality of the show.

## Reporting Issues
If you experience any issues that make you uncomfortable, whether they are listed above or not, please message me directly, and I will attempt to resolve the situation in full confidence. Just ask for my email or WhatsApp.

If you experience an issue with something I do, and do not feel comfortable to raise it directly, please approach a trusted teammate to broach the issue with me, or message me anonymously.

No one will ever be punished for raising an issue. 

## How issues will be dealt with
I will speak directly and confidentially with all involved parties, and try to arrange a resolution that satisfies all involved.

Very serious issues that cannot be resolved will result in the offending party being removed from the team.

I understand that in a free-flowing improv class or show, poor taste jokes can be accidentally made in the fast flow of a scene. This factor will be taken into account. Issues will only reach this stage if they are persistent, repeated, and / or deliberate.

All decisions are at my discretion. To protect myself and others I reserve the right to remove a team-member from the group without notice, if I deem it necessary. I hope I never have to.

## In summary
Have fun. Make sure your teammates are having fun.

Or to quote the great Abraham Lincoln : "Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!"
