            <h1>Improv South Wales - Meet, Play, Laugh</h1>
<p>Improv South Wales is an Improv workshop based in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire.</p>
<p>Would you like to meet new people, be silly, play make believe, play fun group games, make up characters, create stories together, or just have a laugh?</p>
<p>Have you seen shows like Whose line is it anyway? Mock the Week, Ben Schwartz and Friends, or Paul Merton's Impro Chums and thought “that looks fun”?</p>
<p>Why not try improvised comedy aka <strong>improv</strong>!?</p>

<h2>What is Improv?</h2>
<p>It's a skill, a comedy performance style, a theatrical style, a community, a communal activity, and a great way to spend a few hours.</p>
<p>Its defining characteristic is that there is no script. The players make it all up on the spot. A unique experience every time.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">Read more about Improv on Wikipedia</a></p>
<h2>What will I do in the workshop?</h2>
<p>You will play silly group games, do exercises to help you think on your feet, create characters, scenes, and stories, and hopefully have a laugh?</p>
<h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
<p>Yourself, a bottle of water, an open mind and a positive mindset.</p>
<h2>Do I have to perform on stage?</h2>
<p>The workshop is a group activity. You may have the opportunity to perform in front of your classmates, but you don't have to if you don't want to.</p>
<p>In the future we may put on shows, but that's a long way off.</p>
<h2>But I'm not funny!</h2>
<p>You don't need to be funny! In fact it's better if you don't try to be. You just need to be willing to go with the flow, be positive, and react honestly. You'll find you're funny anyway!</p>
<p>## But I'm shy!
That's okay! Improv can even help with that! You will never be forced to do anything that will make you uncomfortable.</p>
<h2>How old do I need to be?</h2>
<p>Improv is for all. For this workshop you need to be between the ages of 18 and 125.</p>
<h2>Who's teaching it?</h2>
<p>My name's Paul, and I've been doing improv since 2019. I'd like to share it the skill and build a local community. I am always interested in any other improvisers or performers who would like to contribute their creativity to the workshop.</p>
<h2>What do I get from it?</h2>
<p>You can learn a new skill. You can meet new people. Some say improv can help with social anxiety, and has therapeutic-like properties, or can improve mental health, but nothing has been proven...</p>
<p>Ultimately, you may get the chance to perform on stage and become a comedy legend!</p>
<h2>Will there be performance opportunities?</h2>
<p>Once there are enough capable people, there's no reason we can't put on a show in any of the many local performance spaces.</p>
<h2>Is there a code of conduct?</h2>
<p>Yes, there is. <a href="/improv/improv-south-wales-code-of-conduct">Read the Code of Conduct</a></p>
